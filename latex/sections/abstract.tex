\begin{abstract}
Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a development methodology aiming to increase software productivity and quality by automatically generating code from higher level abstraction models. Although many tools and research prototypes can generate executable code from models such as UML, generated code could be manually modified by programmers. After code modifications, round-trip engineering (RTRIP) supported by many tools is needed to make the model and code consistent but most of the tools are only applicable to static diagrams such as classes. In this paper, we address the RTRIP of UML State Machine diagrams and code. We propose a RTRIP approach consisting of a forward process, which generates code, and a backward process, which updates the original state machine from the modified generated code. From the proposed approach, we implemented a prototype and conducted several experiments on different aspects of the round-trip engineering to verify the proposed approach.
