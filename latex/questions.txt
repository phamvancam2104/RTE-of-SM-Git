- Code sync or model sync: how to know we have to compare Class1 with ReversedClass, i.e. how to know one was the other before?
  For example we compare their packages. The comparator will say Class1 exists only left, ReversedClass only exists right, but
  won't say Class1 IS ReversedClass with different names only.
==> This is a technological blocking point. We have to assume that the comparator handles this. E.g. it looks into the histories,
i.e. it is heuristic. How do we look into history? E.g. when comparing left and mid, look into history of right?
==> Another way to present it is to say that sync is not handled by us, and demands human interaction because it is very hard. But
then it doesn't suit the "Automatic" in ASE.

We can also present technological limitations as future work and say that we also evaluate the viability of model-code sync
with current Eclipse-based technologies.
