Problem: Gap between MDE developers and programmers
Objective: Bridge the gap between MDE developers and programmers by
           automating sychronization between resources through round-trip engineering

Proposition & contribution:
  1. A framework to implement a development environment with automatic round-trip engineering
     between object-oriented models and object-oriented code
  2. Processes to synchronize model and code that co-evoluted during development
  2. A implementation based on our framework, for round-trip engineering of OMG-standard UML models
     and C++11 code

Actors: model-driven developer, developer, code-driven developer

Use-cases: Generate code, generate code (incrementally), generate code (overwrite), reverse (overwrite), reverse (incrementally)

Future work:
  - Java version
  - Patrick's ReqIF problem (to show that our framework is applicable
    to other problems than UML and C++ sync.)
